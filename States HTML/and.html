            <p class="subtitle">Emerald Isles of India</p>
            <p class="info">A cluster of pristine islands in the Bay of Bengal, the Andaman & Nicobar Islands are renowned for their crystal-clear waters, exotic marine life, and dense tropical forests. Rich in indigenous heritage, the islands are home to ancient tribes and historic landmarks like the Cellular Jail. The coral reefs of Havelock Island, water sports at Radhanagar Beach, and the bioluminescent shores of Neil Island make it a dream destination for adventure seekers. The fusion of South Indian, Bengali, and tribal influences adds a unique flavor to the local culture and cuisine.</p>
