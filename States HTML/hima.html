                <p class="attraction-text">Famous for being home to the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, Mcleod Ganj is culturally blessed by a prominent Tibetan influence owing to the major settlement of Tibetans here who fled their homeland. It is also worth noting that Tibet's exiled government is also based solely in Mcleodganj which is also why it's called the Little Lhasa.</p>
