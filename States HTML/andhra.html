                </p>
                <p class="attraction-text">Located on the east coast of India, the Borra Caves are situated in the Ananthagiri hills of the Araku Valley in Visakhapatnam district. Breath taking hilly terrain, beautiful landscape, semi-evergreen moist deciduous forests, and wild fauna of the Borra Caves are a visual feast.

                    A marvellous creation of nature, the Borra caves were formed when river waters flow through a limestone area, and the calcium carbonate turns into calcium bicarbonate, which is easily washed out by the running water. </p>
