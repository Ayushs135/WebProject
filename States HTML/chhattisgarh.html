                <p class="attraction-title">Mainpat</p>
                <p class="attraction-text">Mainpat is an underrated hill station with green pastures, deep valleys, breathtaking waterfalls, dense forests and untouched rivulets. The hill station hasn’t been completely commercialised yet and receives a relatively smaller influx of tourists compared to its counterparts. Mainpat is often called as Shimla of Chhattisgarh and Mini Tibet owing to its huge Tibetan population and influence over the area. The Tibetan refugees were rehabilitated in Mainpat after the Chinese invasion of Tibet and have since found a home in Mainpat. That’s another great thing about Mainpat, the confluence of cultures and diverse traditions only add to the picturesque village’s charm.</p>

                <p class="attraction-text">The broadest waterfall in India, Chitrakote is popularly known as the Niagara of India, because of its width. Situated in the west side of Jagdalpur in the Bastar District of Chhattisgarh, this waterfall originates from the Indravati river. Chitrakote Falls is at the height of about 30 metres with a width of 985 feet, and during monsoons, you can watch the falls at its full glory. The fall cascades from the top of the cliff in 3 streams during summers.</p>

                <p class="attraction-text">As the name suggests, this is a temple dedicated to Goddess Danteshwari, the deity of earlier Kakatiya rulers, also known as an incarnation of Shakti. Built in the 14th century, the temple was constructed in a typical South Indian style architecture. Chiselled out of black stone, the idol of the Goddess is supposed to possess divine powers. Every year during Dusshera, all the tribals and locals from surrounding towns and villages come to this temple to pay respect to the Goddess. Situated in the middle of a spacious courtyard with beautiful pillars, the temple has four parts that a visitor can explore. </p>
