Constructed in 1591 by Quli Qutub Shah, it marks the founding of Hyderabad and is a testament to the city's rich history and Indo-Islamic architecture. Its name, derived from the Urdu words "Char" (four) and "Minar" (towers), reflects its design, featuring four magnificent minarets that dominate the skyline.</p>
