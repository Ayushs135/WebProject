                <p class="attraction-text">Often referred to as the birthplace of Lord Rama, Ayodhya is deeply entrenched in Hindu mythology and spirituality. Nestled along the banks of the sacred Sarayu River in Uttar Pradesh, Ayodhya stands first among the seven most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus. The name "Ayodhya" itself is deeply intertwined with the Ramayana in which it was known as the capital of the ancient Kosala Kingdom. The Ramayana immortalized Ayodhya through its association with the epic tale of Lord Rama. This ancient city holds immense significance for millions of Hindus, serving as a pilgrimage site where devotees pay homage to Lord Rama and seek spiritual solace.</p>
